### HOW TO RUN THE APP IN TESTING MODE

When operating in Testing Mode (Issue 8), users have the option to enable the "Use Synthetic Location" feature by simply tapping the corresponding button. This functionality allows the application to generate simulated synthetic location updates, independent of the phone's GPS source.

Upon activating the "Use Synthetic Location" feature, the screen will consistently display a speed of 10 miles per hour. Even if the user presses the "Pause" button, the displayed speed will remain at 10 miles per hour. Subsequently, when the user presses "Resume," the location updates will resume, and the displayed speed will continue to remain constant.
